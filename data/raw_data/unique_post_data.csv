•
For me, part of the journey is surrendering to the natural tendencies of my hair, and allowing it to express itself in the way it wants to. Before locs, I spent way too much time trying to make it do what it doesn’t want to do… and I got so frustrated that I cut it off for a good year! I started regrowing my hair Dec 2021, but even then, I kept experiencing extreme breakage trying to create the largest afro I could possibly have. I kept blow drying my hair, detangling it (DRY cause moisture makes the Afro shrink 🙄), and combed it throughout the day in attempts to keep length in Houston humidity. I truly did not know how to care for my hair, and I hated that my hair never did what I wanted it to do. It took a while to realize the impact societal norms had on my perception of my hair. I grew up getting nothing but perms, quick weaves, sew ins and braids. While I eventually learned to loved my 4c texture, I hated the shrinkage that came along with it. Long hair is such a prevalent (but Eurocentric) beauty norm for women and my hair grew up, not down. So with my loc journey I decided to say fuck that. I’m not concerned with having long locs. IDC about length checks or hang time. I care about fostering a loving relationship I’ve never had with my hair. I care about its health. And if length happens to come then I definitely welcome it! But that’s not the goal. The goal is to finally allow my hair to thrive and simply exist openly & unapologetically. So if my locs decide it wants stick out in the air then fuck it we ball 🤙🏽

I retwisted my hair for the 3rd time and it was significantly easier yall 😭 I had more new growth to work with, so the tension required to keep my clips in place was hardly any at all! If you look closely you can still see a clip I missed but these pictures were too bomb to not post 😍.

I also combined 2 locs! There were two locs in the back that were relatively small compared to the rest of my locs and they weren’t doing so well on their own. So I used a loc crochet hook to combine them close to the root and I’m allowing the rest to do its thing!

And this retwist I learned how to locksmith 😭🙌🏽 so the budding is a little bit more controlled than the last retwist, so happy about this new skill ☺️

We’re about a week post retwist so it’s time for a wash. Retwists are fun while it lasts but my scalp needs to be cleansed weekly ‼️ All of the budding close to the root that is red is pretty thick & solid. A tiny bit of the new growth in black is starting to bud a bit. And the rest of the loc is still slowly losing that twist pattern.

Y’all I’m obsessed… I’m honestly shocked every retwist at the growth and change. My hair is usually shrunk up cause I wash my hair more often than most. But I’m always shocked at how much my hair is thriving even when it may look all over the place lol. I’m so proud of myself & my hair.. we’re growing together and the relationship between us has never been better. This is what the journey is about 💕‼️& I can confidently say these are my LOCS like look at them 😭

My locs have shrunk, doubled in size and grew back a little further than the length I started with 🤯 I knew length would come with time but I used to worry about volume… now my locs are breaking my hair ties 🥲

I KNOW YOU’RE TIRED OF HEARING IT BUT: 
✨ Trust The Process ✨

•
It’s been surreal watching my hair through this journey… every 3 months it felt like she changed completely.. growing in ways I never thought possible. Just for reference, I cut my hair off completely and started growing it back Dec 2020. Dyed it red and did red braids for a while. Then July 20th, 2023 I decided to lock up! So the red you see at the end of my hair was the length I retained over 3 years. And in this year alone I’ve DOUBLED the length 🤯
•
So the growth has been such a sight to witness and healing for the inner child I dedicated this journey to. I was raised in a place where my hair (among other things) made me an outcast, and no matter what I did I felt like I could never compare. It was just too different, and different felt bad. And I knew the whole “Different is good” thing but if we’re being honest, as a child the last thing you want to be is different. I wasn’t taught how to embrace my hair, I was taught how to hide it. And that’s what I did, for a long time.
•
When I finally decided not to it was a struggle.. to learn how to style my hair on my own with the help of YouTube.. not to mention I didn’t have the money for styling products. It was frustrating and unhealthy for my mental. So I cut it off and that was liberating. I loved every second of it truly. And having that buzz cut made me different too, but I was in undergrad and the pressure of fitting in just doesn’t hit the same as it does in high school. The weight of your responsibility in the world just pushes all of that shit to the side you know? I stopped thinking about how I was different and started thinking about how I just, am. And how I prefer to just, be. I started to grow my hair again in hopes of having a gigantic afro but, the maintenance was a bitch. So I opted instead for locs ‼️ Now here I am in grad school, with hair I’d die for and loving every second of it 💕

I guess my hair is pretty resilient, cause I’ve never had breakage due to bleach or color 🤷🏽‍♀️ Regardless though I’m still scared to dye my locs.. they’ve come so far and I think I’d break if my hair did… what are y’all thoughts on dying locs?",https://www.instagram.com/p/C_vQ832ubK3/

Actively engaging in non-conformity fuels my soul.. when I do this style and feel beautiful in this style, I further heal the inner child trying so hard to adhere to European beauty standards.

This style actually reminds me so much of a Christmas tree 🎄. My hair reminds me of nature alot in that way ☺️ Any thoughts on what I should name this style?",https://www.instagram.com/p/C_nsQwxur6F/

17866756761192778,17841461458191255,locwithaush,IG image,"I often get asked “how did you get them so thick?”

To put it shortly, I’m not 100% sure 🤷🏽‍♀️ As you can see, they didn’t start this way‼️ This is my first loc journey and I’ve self maintained them, so I can only tell you what I hope contributed to the thickness:

1) Locs generally tend to get thick overtime. As the dead hair sheds into your loc, it will naturally get thicker. I was very worried at Month 3 that my locs would not get thick; I was very wrong.

2) I avoid styling my hair too often. When I retwist my hair, I don’t usually style it. If I do, I keep it in for maybe 2 days and then take them down. And a “style” for me really just one or two ponys.

3) I’ve never been scared of water. Locs are like plants, they need water to grow! I let my locs drench in water pretty much daily in the first 5 months. I did this mostly because I have dandruff, and hydrating my scalp was necessary to keep it healthy. But also my hair gets dense when wet (4c hair), and I like to think the water helped my locs thicken because of that ☺️

4) I considered interlocking my hair in the beginning to make maintenance last longer, but because of how interlocking works, I feared it would keep my locs thin and limit its ability to thicken overtime (not sure if this is actually true) So I ultimately just retwisted and locsmithed my locs. 

I hope this is helpful for everyone hoping for thicker locs ☺️ 

And let me know what y’all think about interlocking 🤔 Do y’all think it constricts and contributes to skinny locs? Or have you seen interlocking on thick locs before?",https://www.instagram.com/p/C_WDu5bOhu3/

1) If your loc is a thicc boii, don’t be afraid to go heavy on the thread length. I thought I had more than enough and was sadly mistaken 😅

2) If your locs are not a solid color you’ll need to make sure the bead & thread color works well with your loc color. The beads should pop, the thread should not ✨I think this bead color works well with my natural color but not so much the tips.

3) Be intentional about where you poke through the loc… it seems obvious going into the loc but it’s not as obvious coming out of the loc, if you have thicc boiis ‼️

What bead color do you think I should try with my locs next??

This is the raw, uncut, untamed progress of a 4c loc journey. I love a good retwist, but the reality is that most days (if you’re washing your hair like you need to) they’re gonna look similar to this ‼️ and personally I love that. But for those with 4c hair considering the loc journey themselves, depending on where you are in your relationship with your hair in its natural state, this can be difficult to accept. A lot of the pictures on the explore page are overwhelmingly either retwists on long locs, locs that are dense enough to fall, and/or locs that are always styled. And they all look amazing, but they’re only a small part of the whole picture. I hope with this post to be authentic about what it looks like throughout the whole journey for some of us, even if it’s not what trends or gets the most likes for the sleekest looks. And the crazy part is it’s still incredibly beautiful, the growth is apparent and the locs are thriving just as much ‼️ Thanks for reading my little rant 🫶🏽 you’re the best ☺️

I also lowkey took a nap before taking this pic so they a little flatter than usual 😂 but I did make an observation that in the early stages I feel like the length was increasing rapidly from month to month because the locs were thinner, so the loc stretched more. I think at this point in the journey, the length is going to slow down a bit, but thickness is going to start kicking in.

I started in 2 strand twists and ended up rinsing my hair daily in the shower in the beginning. Yes I did have the occasional unraveling in the back and I lowkey still do towards the root sometimes, but overall I’m 7 months in and they look amazing ‼️🫶🏽 

Water causes your hair to shrink up causing it tangle into one another and helping the loc process.. if you have coils maybe you shouldn’t rinse as often, but in my experience water is your bestie 🫶🏽
