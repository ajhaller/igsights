•
For me, part of the journey is surrendering to the natural tendencies of my hair, and allowing it to express itself in the way it wants to. Before locs, I spent way too much time trying to make it do what it doesn’t want to do… and I got so frustrated that I cut it off for a good year! I started regrowing my hair Dec 2021, but even then, I kept experiencing extreme breakage trying to create the largest afro I could possibly have. I kept blow drying my hair, detangling it (DRY cause moisture makes the Afro shrink 🙄), and combed it throughout the day in attempts to keep length in Houston humidity. I truly did not know how to care for my hair, and I hated that my hair never did what I wanted it to do. It took a while to realize the impact societal norms had on my perception of my hair. I grew up getting nothing but perms, quick weaves, sew ins and braids. While I eventually learned to loved my 4c texture, I hated the shrinkage that came along with it. Long hair is such a prevalent (but Eurocentric) beauty norm for women and my hair grew up, not down. So with my loc journey I decided to say fuck that. I’m not concerned with having long locs. IDC about length checks or hang time. I care about fostering a loving relationship I’ve never had with my hair. I care about its health. And if length happens to come then I definitely welcome it! But that’s not the goal. The goal is to finally allow my hair to thrive and simply exist openly & unapologetically. So if my locs decide it wants stick out in the air then fuck it we ball 🤙🏽

I retwisted my hair for the 3rd time and it was significantly easier yall 😭 I had more new growth to work with, so the tension required to keep my clips in place was hardly any at all! If you look closely you can still see a clip I missed but these pictures were too bomb to not post 😍.

I also combined 2 locs! There were two locs in the back that were relatively small compared to the rest of my locs and they weren’t doing so well on their own. So I used a loc crochet hook to combine them close to the root and I’m allowing the rest to do its thing!

And this retwist I learned how to locksmith 😭🙌🏽 so the budding is a little bit more controlled than the last retwist, so happy about this new skill ☺️

We’re about a week post retwist so it’s time for a wash. Retwists are fun while it lasts but my scalp needs to be cleansed weekly ‼️ All of the budding close to the root that is red is pretty thick & solid. A tiny bit of the new growth in black is starting to bud a bit. And the rest of the loc is still slowly losing that twist pattern. We’re getting into the teenage stage, I can officially not control the direction of my locs 😭 love them though truly 💕
