Y’all I’m obsessed… I’m honestly shocked every retwist at the growth and change. My hair is usually shrunk up cause I wash my hair more often than most. But I’m always shocked at how much my hair is thriving even when it may look all over the place lol. I’m so proud of myself & my hair.. we’re growing together and the relationship between us has never been better. This is what the journey is about 💕‼️& I can confidently say these are my LOCS like look at them 😭
