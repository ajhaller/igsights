My locs have shrunk, doubled in size and grew back a little further than the length I started with 🤯 I knew length would come with time but I used to worry about volume… now my locs are breaking my hair ties 🥲

I KNOW YOU’RE TIRED OF HEARING IT BUT: 
✨ Trust The Process ✨

I’m looking forward to this next year of growth. I’m thinking most of my back locs will reach my shoulders at the end of year 2. What do y’all think?",0,"07/23/2024 08:30",https://www.instagram.com/p/C9xTF-yOwAE/,"IG image",,Lifetime,75577,4771,126,184,52,434,91526

It’s been surreal watching my hair through this journey… every 3 months it felt like she changed completely.. growing in ways I never thought possible. Just for reference, I cut my hair off completely and started growing it back Dec 2020. Dyed it red and did red braids for a while. Then July 20th, 2023 I decided to lock up! So the red you see at the end of my hair was the length I retained over 3 years. And in this year alone I’ve DOUBLED the length 🤯
•
So the growth has been such a sight to witness and healing for the inner child I dedicated this journey to. I was raised in a place where my hair (among other things) made me an outcast, and no matter what I did I felt like I could never compare. It was just too different, and different felt bad. And I knew the whole “Different is good” thing but if we’re being honest, as a child the last thing you want to be is different. I wasn’t taught how to embrace my hair, I was taught how to hide it. And that’s what I did, for a long time.
•
When I finally decided not to it was a struggle.. to learn how to style my hair on my own with the help of YouTube.. not to mention I didn’t have the money for styling products. It was frustrating and unhealthy for my mental. So I cut it off and that was liberating. I loved every second of it truly. And having that buzz cut made me different too, but I was in undergrad and the pressure of fitting in just doesn’t hit the same as it does in high school. The weight of your responsibility in the world just pushes all of that shit to the side you know? I stopped thinking about how I was different and started thinking about how I just, am. And how I prefer to just, be. I started to grow my hair again in hopes of having a gigantic afro but, the maintenance was a bitch. So I opted instead for locs ‼️ Now here I am in grad school, with hair I’d die for and loving every second of it 💕
