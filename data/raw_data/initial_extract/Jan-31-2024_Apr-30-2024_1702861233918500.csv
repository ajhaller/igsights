This is the raw, uncut, untamed progress of a 4c loc journey. I love a good retwist, but the reality is that most days (if you’re washing your hair like you need to) they’re gonna look similar to this ‼️ and personally I love that. But for those with 4c hair considering the loc journey themselves, depending on where you are in your relationship with your hair in its natural state, this can be difficult to accept. A lot of the pictures on the explore page are overwhelmingly either retwists on long locs, locs that are dense enough to fall, and/or locs that are always styled. And they all look amazing, but they’re only a small part of the whole picture. I hope with this post to be authentic about what it looks like throughout the whole journey for some of us, even if it’s not what trends or gets the most likes for the sleekest looks. And the crazy part is it’s still incredibly beautiful, the growth is apparent and the locs are thriving just as much ‼️ Thanks for reading my little rant 🫶🏽 you’re the best ☺️

My bottom three rows & perimeter had an unreasonable amount of loose hair and it was eventually going to cause my locs to thin. So I wanted to try crocheting the roots before locksmithing them. Scroll to the end to see the results. The top of my head is a bit more controlled so I’m just going to locksmith those without crochet 💕 Stay tuned for the final retwist ‼️🫶🏽

I’ve never been able to go a week post retwist without washing it out due to excessive itching caused by dandruff… but today, I’m 10 DAYS POST RETWIST 😃 I’m not sure what exactly helped, but I’ve been trying a combination of things (comment below if you’re interested in knowing what I’ve been doing ☺️). And I’m not itchy at all. You can even see some of the locs at the top still twisted ‼️ I’m curious to see how long I can comfortably go before the next wash & retwist 😌 I’ll keep you posted 😜 Happy Texture Tuesday!

•

I also lowkey took a nap before taking this pic so they a little flatter than usual 😂 but I did make an observation that in the early stages I feel like the length was increasing rapidly from month to month because the locs were thinner, so the loc stretched more. I think at this point in the journey, the length is going to slow down a bit, but thickness is going to start kicking in. Cause this retwist I really had to put in the work to make them stay twisted especially towards the crown of my head😮‍💨This is just a theory 🤷🏽‍♀️ can’t wait to see what happens and as always I’ll document the progress ‼️

I lowkey already hit 8 months but it’s mid week & I don’t have time for a retwist till the weekend so it’s gonna have to wait a bit 🤭 The month 8 progress pic is coming soon 😃

But I feel there’s so many styles we can do without hella product or tension 🤩 the pony’s I have in rn aren’t even wrapped twice around my hair. And I try not to force what doesn’t naturally fall into the pony. Gonna start exploring some different things to do without damaging my locs ☺️

Who else is scared to style their locs 🫣✋🏽?

I started in 2 strand twists and ended up rinsing my hair daily in the shower in the beginning. Yes I did have the occasional unraveling in the back and I lowkey still do towards the root sometimes, but overall I’m 7 months in and they look amazing ‼️🫶🏽 

Water causes your hair to shrink up causing it tangle into one another and helping the loc process.. if you have coils maybe you shouldn’t rinse as often, but in my experience water is your bestie 🫶🏽
