Sometimes I feel the urge to dye my locs… I was red for so long 😭 when I was loose natural I dyed my hair with box dye all the time. I guess my hair is pretty resilient, cause I’ve never had breakage due to bleach or color 🤷🏽‍♀️ Regardless though I’m still scared to dye my locs.. they’ve come so far and I think I’d break if my hair did… what are y’all thoughts on dying locs?",0,"09/10/2024 06:35",https://www.instagram.com/p/C_vQ832ubK3/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,12711,10908,631,16,16,8,33

Actively engaging in non-conformity fuels my soul.. when I do this style and feel beautiful in this style, I further heal the inner child trying so hard to adhere to European beauty standards.

17866756761192778,17841461458191255,locwithaush,"Aushanae Haller","I often get asked “how did you get them so thick?”

To put it shortly, I’m not 100% sure 🤷🏽‍♀️ As you can see, they didn’t start this way‼️ This is my first loc journey and I’ve self maintained them, so I can only tell you what I hope contributed to the thickness:

1) Locs generally tend to get thick overtime. As the dead hair sheds into your loc, it will naturally get thicker. I was very worried at Month 3 that my locs would not get thick; I was very wrong.

2) I avoid styling my hair too often. When I retwist my hair, I don’t usually style it. If I do, I keep it in for maybe 2 days and then take them down. And a “style” for me really just one or two ponys.

3) I’ve never been scared of water. Locs are like plants, they need water to grow! I let my locs drench in water pretty much daily in the first 5 months. I did this mostly because I have dandruff, and hydrating my scalp was necessary to keep it healthy. But also my hair gets dense when wet (4c hair), and I like to think the water helped my locs thicken because of that ☺️

4) I considered interlocking my hair in the beginning to make maintenance last longer, but because of how interlocking works, I feared it would keep my locs thin and limit its ability to thicken overtime (not sure if this is actually true) So I ultimately just retwisted and locsmithed my locs. 

I hope this is helpful for everyone hoping for thicker locs ☺️ 

And let me know what y’all think about interlocking 🤔 Do y’all think it constricts and contributes to skinny locs? Or have you seen interlocking on thick locs before?",0,"08/31/2024 11:39",https://www.instagram.com/p/C_WDu5bOhu3/,"IG image",,Lifetime,41520,34642,2082,55,67,12,257
